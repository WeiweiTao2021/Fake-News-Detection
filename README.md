# Simulate-Seven-Dwarfs-Mine-Train-Waiting-Times

Thus, in the project, we are aiming to develop a model to predict the waiting time of attractions in Disney World over time. This project utilizes the queuing theory to model waiting times. Based upon the simulated results, visitors can plan ahead before their trips and obtain correct prediction of when their turns will come, thus significantly improving customer satisfaction.
